		"Far to the east of the Old World, even farther east than the fabled lands of Cathay, lie the islands of the Nipponese archipelago. Inhabited by a sophisticated but stoic nation of humans, where warfare is common and honour is everything.",
		"Nipponese society is highly structured and is based on feudal rule in a strict hierarchy from the Emperor, a semi-divine being who is rarely seen in public, down to the lowest peasants who tend the fields. There are many similarities between Nippon and Brettonian society, though Daimyo – the Nippon Lords – are even harsher and uncaring towards anyone they consider to be their inferior than their Bretonnian counterparts. The strongest Daimyo vie for the position of Shogun – supreme military leader of Nippon, answerable only to the Emperor himself.",
		"Each Daimyo maintains a standing army to defend his lands from neighbouring warlords and pirate raids. The army is mainly composed of Samurai, noble warriors who devote their lives to training in the art of war. The Samurai are supported by Ashigaru, soldiers drawn from his common subjects and given basic training and weaponry. More significant threats require several Daimyo to contribute forces to the Emperor’s army, under the command of the Shogun. Sometimes these armies include Mikata – warriors whom a Daimyo may employ outside of their retinue to bolster its strength. These warriors represent the Ronin, Temple Monks, and Junior Samurai. Armies sometimes include Ninja, clans of stealthy warriors, who specialise in all forms of espionage, deception, and covert warfare.",
		"The Nipponese islands are located in the Northern hemisphere of the world, on the same latitude as Ulthuan but the opposite longitude. Many of the magical lines of power which were harnessed into the Great Vortex of the High Elves connect through the planet to Nippon, drawing magical energy away. Thus, the Winds of Magic are relatively thin in this part of the world, so wizards are few.",
		"The Nipponese people are known as highly stoic people from whom expressions of emotion are rare. However, this repressed spiritual energy builds up until it manifests itself in a physical form. Many Nipponese mythical creatures are a natural byproduct of unseen human hopes and fears which can manifest in physical form when emotions are strong or prolonged. Smaller creatures are often a nuisance in daily life and are exorcised before they become too troublesome by a Shugenja, who sometimes draws energy from a magical shrine to assist him in the process.",
		"Larger creatures tend to congregate near temples, drawn by the concentration of emotion and energy at these holy sites. In times of war, they become more common and the Shugenja of the temple can marshal them into useful fighting forces but their control over them is limited and they can disappear back into the magical ether from which they came. The commonest forms are Oni (ogres) who are powerful fighters. If the Shugenja coalesces the energies together onto a physical object such as the Komainu (lion-dog statues which guard temple entrances), the object becomes a living creature. Larger creatures can be created if the temple’s Abbott coalesces the energies into larger objects. These colourful creatures bolster the Nipponese army against significant threats facing the whole nation. However the magical energy used to bind them can prove unstable under battlefield conditions."

Treat the order as issued to the nominated point and apply any modifiers for distance and proximity of enemy but ignore penalties for dense terrain. The nominated point must lie either on the table within dense terrain or on any base edge other than the enemy player‘s own table edge. If successful, place one stand on the nominated spot and arrange the rest of the unit into formation around it. The infiltrated unit cannot be placed so that it touches an enemy unit.
