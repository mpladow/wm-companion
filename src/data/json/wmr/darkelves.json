		"Over five thousand years ago a great civil war erupted amongst the Elven Kingdoms on the island-continent of Ulthuan. Upon one side were the supporters of the Phoenix King whilst upon the other were the supporters of Malekith Lord of Nagarythe. Malekith was the son of Aenarion - the first and greatest of the Phoenix Kings - and his mother was a powerful and influential sorceress called Morathi. Many fair- minded Elves believed that Malekith was the rightful heir to the Phoenix throne. They remembered that he had fought valiantly against the daemontides of Chaos and his noble appearance recalled that of his mighty father.",
		"Morathi nurtured a huge ambition to rule and her son was to provide her with the means to achieve power. She was prepared to go to any ends to realise her ambitions and was fearless and proud even in the face of the gods themselves. She was also skilled in all the arts of magic and especially in the lore of daemons and all manner of necromancy. Unbeknown to the common folk, Her mastery of the dark powers earned her the admiration of many who believed that such forces could be harnessed and used to empower the Elves. Her followers grew in number and she became so bold that the forbidden gods were worshipped openly in the temples of Nagarythe and many flocked to join the new cults.",
		"Thanks in part to his mother‘s efforts Malekith‘s cause prospered even as darkness and corruption spread amongst the elves. As Malekith‘s influence grew he came to believe himself indestructible. So certain was he of his divine destiny that he decided to pass into the flame of Asuryan to prove his right to rule.",
		"By this rite the greatest of the Elven gods grants power and divine authority to the true kings of Ulthuan. But the Elven gods were not bowed by Morathi‘s power and the flame rejected her son. Malekith was not killed, but his body was badly burned and afterwards he made a suit of black armour that he wears to this day. Seriously weakened, blackened of body, his mind warped by pain and resentment, Malekith gave up all pretence of rightful lordship and chose instead to impose his will by force of arms alone.",
		"The long, bitter and bloody war that followed became known as The Sundering – for its result was to divide the Elf race. From then on the High Elves of Ulthuan, the Wood Elves of the abandoned Elf colonies in the Old World, and the Dark Elves of Malekith would develop separately. The Dark Elves were eventually driven out of Ulthuan. The land of Nagarythe and a great part of the other western lands of Ulthuan were torn apart by great magical upheavals as the rival sides battled for supremacy. Nagarythe finally sank beneath the waves. Malekith and his supporters fled to the northern part of the New World where they founded their own kingdom in exile upon the borderlands of Chaos. This they named Naggaroth - which means Land of Chill in Elvish.",
		"From his icy realm Malekith broods over his lost kingdom and weaves dark spells against his enemies. His ships harass those of the High Elves, his raiders harry the coasts of Ulthuan and the Old World, whilst his generals plan to return to their homeland and win the Elven Kingdoms for their dark master. In the land of Naggaroth the Dark Elves raised temples to all manner of blood-thirsty Daemons. Witch Elves roam the night searching for sacrifices, breaking into home to steal away children, and murdering those foolish enough to walk abroad beneath the stars. Under the evil gaze of Morathi thousands are sacrificed upon the altars of Khaine while to this day she preserves her unholy youth by bathing in the blood of innocents."
