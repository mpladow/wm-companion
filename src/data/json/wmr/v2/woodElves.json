		"It is safe to say that the Wood Elves are not the most active campaigners in the Warhammer world; rather the vast majority of their battles are fought in the defence of Loren – a cause to which they are dedicated with single-minded determination. Due mainly to their small numbers, the Wood Elves prefer to deal with their enemies using deception and guile rather than attacking head-on. Death through traps, ambushes and the unseen arrow all await the unwary intruder into the enchanted forest kingdom of the Wood Elves. Indeed, a large Wood Elf host will only be assembled to fight an open, pitched battle under the direst of circumstances, most often to repel a determined invading army. In such times as these, the Wood Elf warriors will fall upon their opponents with all the savagery of the Wild"

To infiltrate a unit, the Wood Elf player nominates the point where he wants the Waywatchers to appear and issues an 'infiltration' order from any character. The character does not have to be within his normal command range to issue an infiltration order - the character's command range is considered to extend over the entire tabletop when issuing an infiltration order. Treat the order as issued to the nominated point, and apply any modifiers for distance and proximity of enemy, but ignore penalties of dense terrain. The nominated point must lie either on the table within dense terrain or on any base edge other than the enemy player's own table edge. If successful, place one stand on the nominated spot and arrange the rest of the unit around it. The infiltrated unit cannot be placed so that it touches an enemy unit. Once deployed, orders can be given to the unit by the same character that gave the infiltration order if he is within his normal command range, the infiltrating unit is considered to have used its first order to deploy. If the infiltration order is failed the unit is not deployed and cannot infiltrate that turn, it can attempt to infiltrate in a subsequent turn at the same or a different place."
