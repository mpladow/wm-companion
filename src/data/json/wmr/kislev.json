	"description": [
		"The land of Kislev lies in the north-eastern portion of the Old World between towering mountains to the east, the barren wastes of the Troll Country to the west and the borders of the Empire to the south. Dense pine forests give way to scattered birch forests and desolate tundra to the north. It is an old saying that in Kislev the winters are long, the snow lies deep, and enemies are never far away.",
		"Kislev shares its southern border with the Empire but in every other direction it is surrounded by deadly foes. The eastern mountains are full of goblins and other greenskins whilst beyond the lands are home to savage marauder tribes. To the north-west is the land of Norsca - barbarians in thrall to the Dark Gods. When the armies of Chaos gather Kislev lies directly in their path between the forces of darkness and the lands to the south. With typically grim humour Kislevites describe their land as lying between the hammer and the anvil (meaning Chaos and the Empire).",
		"Kislev is reckoned a backward and barbarous country by the people of the southlands. Some even go as far as to say that the Kislevites are little better than the savage marauder tribes themselves. There is some truth in this - because the people of Kislev are an admixture of native Old Worlders like the people of the Empire and a marauding Kurgan tribe called the Gospodars. As with the tribes of Chaos there are those amongst the Kislevites who possess the gift of prophecy and other sorcerous abilities. The ruling family of the Tzars is descended directly from the Sorceress Khan-Queens of the Gospodars. Female members of the family often possess great powers. This mixture of southern and northern blood makes the Kislevites seem exotic and dangerous to the people of the Empire."

The unit must always be in one of two formations: a wagon column with the horse team in front of the wagon, and a wagon laager with the horse team placed beside the wagon edge to edge.",
				"",
				"When a War Wagon moves it must always finish its move in a wagon column. In other respects the wagon unit moves like any other unit of two stands. The wagon cannot charge an enemy. Its movement rate is 20cm at full pace and 10cm at half pace the same as infantry. A unit in wagon column at the start of the move moves at full pace, a unit in wagon laager at the start of the move moves at half pace. A wagon treats terrain in the same way as artillery.",
				"",
				"A War Wagon in wagon column formation can be given an order to form a laager. A War Wagon can also form a laager using initiative - i.e. if visible enemy are within 20cm at the start of the move. This is an exception to the normal rules for initiative, which allow units to charge or evade as described in the rulebook. Note that a wagon cannot move and form laager by means of a single order - a separate order is required to form a wagon laager. When a wagon forms laager, either stand can be pivoted to face any direction, the other stand is then placed in formation alongside it.",
				"",
				"Either stand can be removed as a casualty if sufficient hits are inflicted to remove a stand from the unit. The War Wagon has an Armour rating of 4+ so long as the wagon stand is present. If the wagon stand is removed as a casualty the remaining team stand has no Armour (no save).",
				"",
				"The War Wagon can shoot all around and can draw a line of sight from any exposed edge. Though consisting of two stands, the War Wagon cannot make more than four shooting attacks in total. The wagon has a range of 30cm. The target’s armour value counts one worse than usual, for example 4+ counts as 5+, and 6+ becomes 0. The wagon is permitted to shoot over the heads of friendly troops on lower ground in the same way as other artillery (see page 73). Note that the wagon’s Attacks are a combination of crewmen and light guns - shots do not ‘bounce’ as described under the rules for Cannons in the Warmaster rulebook.",
				"",
				"A laagered wagon counts as a defended unit. A wagon column counts as in the open.",
				"",
				"A laagered wagon unit counts all its edges as front edges - it has no sides or rear and no combat penalties are applied on account of fighting to the side or rear.",
				"",
				"Though consisting of two stands, the War Wagon can never make more than 4 attacks in combat in total.",
				"",
				"A laagered wagon cannot be driven back or routed by shooting. However - it is still deemed necessary to roll drive backs (remember it is defended) to determine if War Wagon becomes confused on a roll of a 6. The same applies to Gerroff!!! spell. Roll the dice as normal. If the wagon would normally have left the table then roll 1 D6. If a 6 is rolled it is confused.",
				"",
				"If a wagon column is engaged in combat then it cannot pursue if it wins the combat round, and it is destroyed if forced to retreat. Note this is the standard rule for artillery.",
				"",
				"If a laagered War Wagon is engaged in combat then it will neither pursue nor retreat regardless of the combat result. The War Wagon is not destroyed in the same way as artillery if it loses a combat round. It always holds its ground regardless of the result and continues to count as defended in subsequent rounds. An enemy unit that wins a round of combat against the wagon can continue to fight by ‘pursuing’ in the normal way, but no pursuit bonuses are gained for doing so.",
				"",
				"Any Kislev infantry unit positioned so that the side edge of at least one stand touches any edge of the wagon stand (not the team stand) of a laagered War Wagon unit counts the whole unit as defended for purposes of shooting and combat (i.e. the infantry unit must line up so that the wagon stand and any infantry stand from the unit would be in a mutually supporting position were they both infantry). This assumes some intermingling of infantry in the wagon laager which is otherwise impossible to represent, but can be readily imagined. This advantage applies only in the first round of combat when charged, in exactly the same way as defended units on high ground or amongst woods or other dense terrain. Note that these associated infantry do not retain defended status in subsequent rounds as does the War Wagon itself, even where they remain in touch with the wagon stand.",
				"",
				"Note that as described above, either the wagon or the team stand can be removed as a casualty - it is up to the player to decide which to remove. If the horses are removed the War Wagon cannot move. If the wagon is removed the horses can move but obviously cannot attack - this gives the player the opportunity to retreat the ‘horses’ out of harms way thus avoiding losing the unit. The unit is not destroyed until both stands have been removed as normal."
